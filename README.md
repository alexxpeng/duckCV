# duckCV
simple duck object recognition using Arduino Nicla Vision using Edge Impulse FOMO ML and tensorflow neural network

https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/286329
- ML object detection model generated using FOMO
- using a dataset of 75 images

niclaVisionFiles -> firmware, firmware.bin is primary image
duckCVModel -> model files placed in openmv compile
src -> python scripts for dataset capture and duck recognition
